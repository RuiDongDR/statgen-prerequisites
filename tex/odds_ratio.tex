\Huge{Odds Ratio}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Intuitional Description}
Odds ratio provides an intuitive measure of association strength between genetic variants and \textbf{binary outcomes} (like disease status) by comparing the odds of disease given a particular genotype to the odds without it, while logistic regression extends this concept to model the log-odds of disease as a linear function of genetic markers, allowing for multiple variants and covariates to be analyzed simultaneously.

\begin{frame}{Key Formula}
In logistic regression for genetic association studies, we model the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., disease status) as a function of genetic markers:

$$
\text{logit}(p_i) = \ln\left(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i
$$

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $p_i$ is the probability of disease for individual $i$
\item $\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}$ is the odds of disease for individual $i$
\item $X_i$ is the genotype for individual $i$ at a single marker (e.g., coded as 0, 1, 2 for the number of minor alleles)
\item $\beta_0$ is the intercept
\item $\beta_1$ is the log odds ratio per unit increase in $X$ (to be estimated)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Technical Details: Definition of Odds}

The odds for an event with probability $p$ is defined as:

$$
\text{Odds} = \frac{p}{1-p}
$$

For example, if the probability of disease is 0.2 (20%), then the odds of disease are $\frac{0.2}{0.8} = 0.25$, or 1:4.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Technical Details: Definition of Odds Ratio}

The odds ratio compares the odds of disease between two groups. For a genetic variant with genotypes AA, Aa, and aa (where a is the risk allele), the odds ratio for aa vs. AA would be:

$$
\text{OR} = \frac{\text{Odds(Disease|aa)}}{\text{Odds(Disease|AA)}}
$$

In the logistic regression in the Key Formula section, the odds ratio (OR) can be calculated as:

$$
\text{OR} = e^{\beta_1}
$$

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Technical Details: Interpretation in Genetics}

\begin{itemize}
\item OR = 1: No association between genotype and disease
\item OR > 1: The variant increases disease risk (e.g., OR = 2 means individuals with this genotype have twice the odds of disease)
\item OR < 1: The variant decreases disease risk (protective effect)
\end{itemize}
