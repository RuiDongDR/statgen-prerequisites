    "The Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) is a statistical test used to compare the fit of two models: a **null model** and an **alternative model**. The null model usually represents a simpler hypothesis (e.g., no effect), and the alternative model represents a more complex hypothesis (e.g., an effect exists). \n",

    ">\n",
    "> Note that we have deliberately focused on the likelihood ratio, and not the actual likelihood values themselves. This is because actual likelihood values are generally not useful - it is only the ratios that matter when comparing the models. One way of thinking about this is that the actual likelihood values are very context dependent, and so likelihoods from different data sets are not comparable with one another. However, the meaning of the likelihood ratio is in some sense consistent across contexts: LR =1.8 means that the data favour the first model by a factor of 1.8 whatever the context."
