    "## Heritability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of Heritability\n",
    "\n",
    "Heritability is a fundamental concept in genetics that quantifies the proportion of phenotypic variance attributable to genetic factors. There are two main types of heritability:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Broad-sense heritability ($H^2$)**: The proportion of phenotypic variance that is due to all genetic factors, including additive, dominance, and epistatic effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2_G}{\\sigma^2_P}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$)**: The proportion of phenotypic variance that is due only to additive genetic effects, which are the effects transmitted from parents to offspring.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2_A}{\\sigma^2_P}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\sigma^2_G$ is the total genetic variance\n",
    "- $\\sigma^2_A$ is the additive genetic variance\n",
    "- $\\sigma^2_P$ is the total phenotypic variance\n",
    "\n",
    "Narrow-sense heritability is particularly important in breeding and quantitative genetics as it represents the proportion of phenotypic variance that responds to selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection between PVE and Heritability\n",
    "\n",
    "When we consider multiple genetic variants in a random effect model, the total percentage of variance explained across all variants relates to heritability. If we assume that all genetic effects are captured by the variants in our model, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h^2 \\approx \\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\text{PVE}_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a polygenic random effect model where all genetic variants ($J$) are included:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y = \\theta_b + \\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\theta_j X_{\\cdot,j} + \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With $\\theta_j \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_\\theta)$, the total genetic variance is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma^2_G = \\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\sigma^2_\\theta \\times 2f_j(1-f_j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the narrow-sense heritability becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2_G}{\\sigma^2_G + \\sigma^2_\\epsilon}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is equivalent to the total percentage of variance explained by all variants.\n"

    "## Estimating Heritability Using Random Effect Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, heritability can be estimated using mixed linear models that incorporate both fixed and random effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variance Component Methods**: Estimate the variance components ($\\sigma^2_G$ and $\\sigma^2_\\epsilon$) using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) or Bayesian methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Genomic REML (GREML)**: Uses a genomic relationship matrix (GRM) to estimate heritability from genome-wide SNP data.\n",
