    "A **collider** is a variable that is influenced by both the independent variable (SNP) and the dependent variable (height). When we condition on a collider, we may introduce bias by creating a spurious association between the independent and dependent variables.\n",

    "## Example in Statistical Genetics\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are studying the effect of a genetic variant (SNP) on a trait (e.g., height). **Study participation** can act as a collider between SNP and height.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SNP influences study participation**: Certain genetic variants are associated with specific traits (like height), making individuals with these variants more likely to participate in studies related to those traits.\n",
    "- **Height influences study participation**: Taller individuals may be more likely to participate in a study about height due to an inherent interest or preexisting knowledge about their trait.\n",

    "## Why Study Participation is a Collider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SNP influences study participation**: Individuals with specific SNPs may be more predisposed to certain traits (like height), making them more likely to participate in studies focusing on those traits.\n",
    "2. **Height influences study participation**: Taller people may have an interest in studying height-related genetics or may be more aware of their height as a characteristic, increasing their likelihood to participate in height-focused studies.\n",
    "3. **Collider bias**: If we control for study participation in the analysis, we condition on a variable that is influenced by both the SNP and height. This opens up a backdoor path between the SNP and height, leading to a **spurious association** between the two.\n"

    "In this analysis, we are examining the relationship between `Variant 2` (the SNP mutation) and `y` (height) using data from only the participants in the study. The results are as follows:\n",

    "  - This creates a spurious association between `Variant 2` and height because the study participation variable \"opens a backdoor path\" from the SNP to height, making it appear as though there is a direct relationship between `Variant 2` and height when, in fact, the true effect may be confounded by participation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the estimated effect of `Variant 2` on height may be **biased** and not reflect the true relationship between the SNP and height. The effect seen in this model may arise from the selection of participants based on their genotype and height rather than a direct causal effect of the SNP on height.\n"
