    "## Confounder definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "A **confounder** is a variable that influences both the independent variable (genotype) and the dependent variable (trait), creating a spurious relationship between the two. If not controlled for, a confounder can distort the true relationship between the genotype and the trait.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confounding can cause bias in the estimation of the relationship between the genotype and the trait. To avoid this bias, confounders **must be controlled** in the analysis, typically by including them as covariates in regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example in Statistical Genetics\n",
    "  Suppose we are studying the effect of a genetic variant (genotype) on a trait (e.g., height). If **genetic ancestry** influences both the genotype and height, it is a confounder. Failing to control for ancestry could lead to biased estimates of the genetic effect on the trait.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graphical Representation: [FIXME -- do the figure in a better way]**\n",
    "$$ \\text{Genotype} \\leftarrow \\textbf{Ancestry} \\to \\text{Height} $$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, **ancestry** represents the confounder that affects both the genotype and the trait (height).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ancestry is a confounder in the relationship between SNPs and height because it affects both variables independently. \n",
    "- Different ancestral populations have different genetic backgrounds, which means SNP frequencies vary across populations. \n",
    "- At the same time, ancestry is also associated with height due to both genetic and environmental factors (e.g., nutrition, living conditions). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because ancestry influences both the presence of specific SNPs and height but is not part of the direct causal pathway, failing to account for it can create a misleading association between the SNP and height that is actually driven by ancestry differences rather than a true biological effect of the SNP."
