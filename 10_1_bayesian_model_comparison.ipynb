    "### Compare $M_1$ and $M_2$ based on data $D$\n",
    "When comparing two models $M_1$ and $M_2$, we calculate the **posterior odds** for each model. The **posterior odds** represent the ratio of the posterior probabilities for the two models. This can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{P(M_1|D)}{P(M_2|D)} = \\frac{P(D|M_1)P(M_1)}{P(D|M_2)P(M_2)}\n",

    "- $P(M_2|D)$ is the **posterior** probability of model $M_2$ given the data $D$.\n",
    "- $P(D|M_1)$ and $P(D|M_2)$ are the **likelihoods** of the data under models $M_1$ and $M_2$, respectively.\n",
    "- $P(M_1)$ and $P(M_2)$ are the **prior probabilities** of models $M_1$ and $M_2$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ratio simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Prior Odds} \\times \\text{Likelihood Ratio (LR)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Prior Odds** = $\\frac{P(M_1)}{P(M_2)}$ is the ratio of prior probabilities of the models.\n",
    "- **Likelihood Ratio (LR)** = $\\frac{P(D|M_1)}{P(D|M_2)}$ is the ratio of the likelihoods of the data under each model.\n",

The larger the Bayes Factor, the stronger the evidence in favor of one model. A Bayes Factor close to 1 indicates that the models are equally supported by the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the posterior probabilities for each model are computed by integrating the likelihood over the parameter space of the model and multiplying it by the prior probability. This allows us to calculate the **posterior distribution** for each model, which captures the uncertainty about the modelâ€™s parameters after observing the data.\n",
